<h2>Quantum Information Science</h2>
<ul>
	Working at the intersection of chemistry, physics, and materials science provides a unique perspective that can be used to identify and screen defects, materials, and molecules for use in quantum communication, computation, and sensing.
</ul>

<h2>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h2>
<ul>
	The task of automating complex discovery and operational workflows can be achieved through the application of supervised, unsupervised, and active learning methods, where both labeled and unlabeled datasets can help fine tune models with utilization in autonomous discovery.
</ul>

<h2>Surface Science</h2>
<ul>
	Scanning probe microscopy has made vast impact within the nanoscience field and has been extended to understand quasiparticle phenomena at the relevant length and time scales necessary to capture the insight necessary to design and build devices from the bottom-up, image the electronic and structural landscape of relevant semiconductor and optoelectronic materials, and to even visualize peptide formation at the picometer scale.
</ul>
